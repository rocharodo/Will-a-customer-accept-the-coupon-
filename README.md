# Will-a-customer-accept-the-coupon-
The goal of this project is to use what you know about visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those that did not.

<h1>Observations</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Bar coupons not seem to be very popular among this population as only 41% of the population accepted the Bar coupon</li>
    <li>Based on this investigation, people that go to a bar more than once a month, have passengers that are not a kid and are not widowed seem to be the best candidates for accepting the coupons.
</li>
    <li>Age does not seem to be a deterministic factor as we can see people under the age of 30 have a very similar acceptance rate to those over the age of 25. Perhaps further investigation is needed as there is an overlap with age 26 as it is on both samples</li>
    <li>Drivers with a Kid(s) as a passenger seem to be less responsive to the coupons</li>
    <li>Those drivers that go to a bar more than once a month are keener to accept the coupon</li>
</ol>
